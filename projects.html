    <h3>Eytrix</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Status:</b> Acquired by Meta in August 2025<br>
        <b>Description:</b> Led the end-to-end design and implementation of an AI-driven video surveillance platform for government and enterprise clients. Architected custom real-time detection models for events and anomalies using multi-modal inputs (RGB, low-light, reference-guided similarity matching). Built a continual learning pipeline allowing organizations to upload reference images and automatically update detection models. Developed distributed inference infrastructure optimized for hybrid deployment across cloud, on-premise, and edge environments, delivering low-latency performance on both GPU and CPU hardware. Designed high-throughput video processing pipelines for multi-camera ingest, event filtering, and analytics, supported by microservices architecture with granular RBAC, audit logging, SSO integrations, and automated report generation. Led development of enterprise features including customizable detection policies, mobile and SMS alerting flows, and organization-specific model configurations.<br>

    <h3>Adaptive Streaming of Multimedia Content</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Associated with:</b> Netflix<br>
        <b>Description:</b> Developed a computer-implemented method for adaptive streaming of multimedia content, focusing on dynamically adjusting audio quality while maintaining a specified minimum video quality. The system ensures seamless multimedia streaming by prioritizing video quality and dynamically adjusting the audio quality in real-time based on network conditions. This approach optimizes the user experience by providing consistent video quality while adapting audio quality to available bandwidth.<br>

    <h3>Content-Based Split Tunneling for Network Traffic</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Associated with:</b> Netflix<br>
        <b>Description:</b> Developed a system for split tunneling based on content type to selectively exclude certain network traffic from a VPN tunnel. The solution involved monitoring session traffic, identifying if the traffic corresponds to a specific content type and dynamically redirecting it based on a predefined policy. This approach optimizes network performance by routing traffic based on its type, ensuring more efficient use of the tunnel and improving overall system efficiency.
